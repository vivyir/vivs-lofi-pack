# Vivian's Lo-Fi music pack!

This is a lofi music pack for CDDA that I made for use in my own YouTube videos. Just replace your soundpack's `music` folder with the music folder included here and you'll be good to go!

Full duration of the playlist: `1:13:15`

For a list of songs check out `credits.txt` in the repository, also, all songs in this music pack are usable in YouTube videos given that you include the contents of `credits.txt` in your description, my personal favourite way to do that is by linking the raw version of it on github:
